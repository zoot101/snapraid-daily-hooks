Description: Collection of Hook Scripts for use with SnapRAID-DAILY
 The following Hook Scripts are included:
 .
  * Hook for Sending Notifications via Apprise that supports services
    such as Telegram, ntfy, Slack, Discord, Standard email and many
    more.
  * Hook for Healthchecks.io (https://healthchecks.io) to specify
    whether the job runs successfully or not.
  * Hook for Stopping/Starting Services via Systemd. The services
    are stopped when the main SnapRAID-DAILY script starts and
    restarted again when it finishes. Can be useful if there are
    services which could modify files while SnapRAID is running.
  * Hook for Executing a list of Commands at the start and end,
    a sample use-case could be to mount and unmount the SnapRAID
    parity disk(s).
