snapraid-daily-hooks (0.3.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a hook script for use with Apprise
    - Generates condensed version of the Email Body that better suits
      services like ntfy or Telegram.

  * Added dependency for Apprise since it is now packaged and 
    incorporated into Debian since 12 (Bookworm).

  * Removed ntfy hook script as its functionality is much better served
    via Apprise.
