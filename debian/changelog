snapraid-daily-hooks (0.3.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Updated Apprise hook condensed log function to be compatible
    with new versions of the main SnapRAID-DAILY script that
    will support multiple start/end/notification hooks.
    - Support for older versions of the main script is uneffected.

  * Fixed issue where overall result did not appear in condensed
    log for non-email notifications for conditions where the main
    script ended in warning along with some other cases in the Apprise
    Hook.

snapraid-daily-hooks (0.3.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added script version to Apprise hook printouts.

  * Added the SnapRAID-DAILY Script version to the condensed
    notification log printout.

  * Added an option to the Apprise hook to specify a custom path to
    the apprise binary, for the Apprise hook script. This for cases
    where the apprise binary is in a different location than $PATH
    (Closes #2).

  * Where the main script ends in Warning and passes in a logfile from
    the SnapRAID Command that generated the error, a check is now done
    in the Apprise hook on the size of this file and the user is notified
    if it is greater than 15MB. This is because this can cause issues
    for certain notification services (ntfy is an example) (Closes #1).

  * No changes to other hook scripts.
